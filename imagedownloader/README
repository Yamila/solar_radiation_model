The configuration of this service requires a lot of software installations. To simplify the deployment we offer a bash script that perform all the process on a fresh CentOS 6 system. You only need to execute the next line as *root*:

# ./configure_env

If you want to get your hands dirty, in the nexts sections we explain the main steps necesary to put this service to work.

PREREQUISITE
------------

Before the installation you should install several things in order to obtain all the necesary libreries and external software.

First you should install the EPEL repository, using these steps:

# wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
# wget http://rpms.famillecollet.com/enterprise/remi-release-6.rpm
# sudo rpm -Uvh remi-release-6*.rpm epel-release-6*.rpm

Second you should install a python interpreter. In this project we used the python 2.7.3 version to avoid libraries problems on the server deployment process.

If you are using a machine with CentOS 6, the necesary steps to setup *python* are:

# yum groupinstall -y "Development tools"
# yum install -y zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel readline-devel tk-devel
# wget http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/Python-2.7.5.tar.bz2
# tar xf Python-2.7.5.tar.bz2
# cd Python-2.7.5
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
# make && make altinstall

Then you should install *pip*, but pip requires *distribute* to be installed. The steps to install *distribute* are:

# wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.39.tar.gz
# tar xf distribute-0.6.39.tar.gz
# cd distribute-0.6.39
# python2.7 setup.py install

And then to install *pip*, the steps are:

# curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
# python get-pip.py

After the pip installation, you should install the postgresql database engine (we use the version 9.1), to do that the steps are:

# curl -O http://yum.postgresql.org/9.1/redhat/rhel-6-i386/pgdg-centos91-9.1-4.noarch.rpm
# rpm -ivh pgdg-centos91-9.1-4.noarch.rpm
# yum install -y postgresql91-server postgresql91-devel postgresql91-libs
# service postgresql-9.1 initdb
# chkconfig postgresql-9.1 on
# service postgresql-9.1 start

Then, you should change the password of the 'postgre' user. To do so, execute:

# patch /var/lib/pgsql/9.1/data/pg_hba.conf < pg_hba.conf.patch
# chown postgres /var/lib/pgsql/9.1/data/pg_hba.conf
# service postgresql-9.1 restart

# psql -U postgres

Then, when the psql prompt is active, the step is:

> ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';

INSTALLATION
------------

First you should install the python libraries:

# pip-2.7 install -r requirements.txt

Then, deploy the database (create empty database, create tables, migrate to the last state) using the next line:

# ./resetdb.sh

When the console ask you for a user you should say *yes*, and complete with:

user:    dev
email:   <any real of fake email address>
pass:    dev
re-pass: dev

RUNNING
-------

There are 2 things to run: the *frontend* and the *backend*. First we recommend you to run the *frontend* using the next steps:

# python2.7 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80

Now you can go to a browser on the same machine and use the address "http://localhost/admin" to login to the service. Remember to use the previous data.

Play a lot, and try to understand each part of the page.

After that, when you are ready to start the *backend* (the download engine), you should use the next line:

# python2.7 manage.py runbackend
